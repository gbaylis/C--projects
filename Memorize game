/*
C++
a memorize game / created on Mar 25th 2019
you get to create the question and the answer
this way you can type complex programming statements once
and have this quiz, repeat the question at you until you remember it

q1...q2 = questions
a1....a2 = answer 
r = response, for when you are being quizzed
